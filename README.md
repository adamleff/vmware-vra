# VMware vRA Gem

Client gem for interacting with VMware's vRealize Automation application.

Not all vRA functionality is included in this gem; only API calls necessary 
to interact with the catalog, requests, and existing items is included.

The primary goal of this gem is to provide a reusable set of methods in order
to create Chef plugins for knife, test-kitchen, and provisioning.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vmware-vra'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vmware-vra

## Usage

First, load in the gem.

```
require 'vra'
=> true
```

Then, set up your client object.  You will need to know your tenant ID from your vRA administrator.

```
vra = Vra::Client.new(username: 'devmgr@corp.local', password: 'mypassword', tenant: 'mytenant', base_url: 'https://vra.corp.local', verify_ssl: true)
=> #<Vra::Client:0x000000034c0df8 ... >
```

To list all items in the catalog:

```
vra.catalog.all_items
=> [{"@type"=>"CatalogItem", "id"=>"a9cd6148-6e0b-4a80-ac47-f5255c52b43d", "version"=>2, "name"=>"CentOS 6.6", "description"=>"Blueprint for deploying a CentOS Linux development server", ... }]
```

To only list the items in the catalog for which you are entitled to request:

```
vra.catalog.entitled_items
=> [{"@type"=>"ConsumerEntitledCatalogItem", "catalogItem"=>{"id"=>"d29efd6b-3cd6-4f8d-b1d8-da4ddd4e52b1", "version"=>2, "name"=>"WindowsServer2012", "description"=>"Windows Server 2012", ... }]
```

When you are ready to request an item from the catalog, create a new catalog request object:

```
catalog_request = vra.catalog.request('a9cd6148-6e0b-4a80-ac47-f5255c52b43d', cpus: 1, memory: 512, requested_for: 'devmgr@corp.local', lease_days: 30)
=> #<Vra::CatalogRequest:0x00000003477c20 ... >
```

vRA requires your sub-tenant (a.k.a. "business group") to be specified when requesting an item from the catalog.  If the catalog item you are requesting is specifically created for a given business group, the gem will use that ID automatically without you needing to specify it.

However, if there is no sub-tenant ID available for us to use, you will receive an error when you submit:

```
request = catalog_request.submit
ArgumentError: Unable to submit request, required param(s) missing => subtenant_id
	from /home/aleff/vmware-vra/lib/vra/catalog_request.rb:42:in `validate_params!'
	from /home/aleff/vmware-vra/lib/vra/catalog_request.rb:99:in `submit'
	from (irb):4
	from /opt/chefdk/embedded/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'

```

In this case, you will need to supply the sub-tenant ID manually:

```
catalog_request.subtenant_id = '5327ddd3-1a4e-4663-9e9d-63db86ffc8af'
=> "5327ddd3-1a4e-4663-9e9d-63db86ffc8af"
```

Now, submit your request!  The client will return a new "Request" object you can use to query for status.

```
request = catalog_request.submit
=> #<Vra::Request:0x000000027caea0 ... >

request.status
=> "IN_PROGRESS"
```

You can easily refresh your request object to get the latest status:

```
request.refresh && request.status
=> "SUCCESSFUL"

request.completion_state
=> "SUCCESSFUL"

request.completion_details
=> "Request succeeded. Created hol-dev-32."
```

You can also save the request ID for later, and create a new request object at your leisure to follow-up on your request:

```
request.id
=> "aed22465-02db-481d-b55a-cefe216096a2"

new_request = vra.requests.by_id('aed22465-02db-481d-b55a-cefe216096a2')
=> #<Vra::Request:0x0000000564ac30 ... >

new_request.status
=> "SUCCESSFUL"
```

When the request is successful, you can query the resources created as the result of your request.  Assuming that the catalog item blueprint we requested only creates a single VM, we can get that resource and learn more information about it:

```
resource = request.resources.first
=> #<Vra::Resource:0x00000006772e68 ... >

resource.network_interfaces
=> [{"NETWORK_ADDRESS"=>"192.168.110.203", "NETWORK_MAC_ADDRESS"=>"00:50:56:ae:1d:c7", "NETWORK_NAME"=>"vxw-dvs-35-virtualwire-2-sid-5000-Edge_Transport"}]

resource.ip_addresses
=> ["192.168.110.203"]

resource.name
=> "hol-dev-32"
```

And just like requests, you can save the resource ID and query it again later:

```
resource.id
=> "331fd10b-f2a2-40ae-86bc-1255c1ee9a6d"

new_resource = vra.resources.by_id('331fd10b-f2a2-40ae-86bc-1255c1ee9a6d')
=> #<Vra::Resource:0x000000067c13b0 ... >

new_resource.name
=> "hol-dev-32"
```

When you no longer need the VM, you can destroy it, which returns another request object you can query for status:

```
destroy_req = resource.destroy
=> #<Vra::Request:0x00000006ea90d8 ... >

destroy_req.status
=> "SUCCESSFUL"
```

You can also list all resources and requests you have permission to see with these methods:

```
vra.resources.all_resources
vra.requests.all_requests
```
